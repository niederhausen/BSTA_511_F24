### Why is `{.unnumbered}` included at the end of some of the section headers on the HW?

* I added the option for the sections to be numbered in the YAML (`number-sections: true`) so that the R exercises at the end of the file are numbered. 
* However, the book exercises already have their own numbering, and so I added `{.unnumbered}` to the section headers of the book exercises so that they are not numbered twice. 


## Recordings

* __Pre-recorded__ lessons are on [Echo Cloud](https://echo360.org/section/4a58d645-5753-4e4f-b962-f8825f59baba/home) (aka echo 360 or echo video).
    * These can be accessed in Sakai by navigating to the BSTA 511/611 page and clicking on the `Echo Cloud` option in the left-side menu. 
    * This will redirect you to an echo video page with a list of pre-recorded videos.
* __In-class__ recording links are on [Sakai](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-511-1-AA-F24/tool/1f70eae0-e36a-4052-9247-69c6917e6b73/). Navigate to _Course Materials_ -> _Schedule with links to in-class recordings_. Note that the password to the recordings is at the top of the page.

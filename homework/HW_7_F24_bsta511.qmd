## Directions

::: callout-important
-   Complete all exercises in this assignment using Quarto.
-   I highly recommend using LaTeX to format equations.
    -   See the .qmd files from class notes for LaTeX code to make it easier to show your work in computations.
    -   For instructions on creating equations in the Visual editor, check out <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html#equations>. [html](../slides_code/Probability_distributions_in_R_bsta511.qmd)
    -   Also check out examples of [LaTeX formatting for statistics](https://nwakim.github.io/S2024_BSTA_513/extra_resources/Latex_qmd_formatting.html) created by recent biostats alum Ariel Weingarten.
    -   If you have difficulty rendering the LaTeX equations, I recommend installing and running the R package `tinytex`. See this [website](https://evalsp20.classes.andrewheiss.com/reference/install/#install-tinytex-1) for instructions.
:::

-   Please upload your homework to [Sakai](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-511-1-AA-F24/tool/8cee686f-e5e0-401c-a7c1-b097fc8eb9a9). **Upload both your .qmd code file and the rendered .html file**.

-   Please always use the following naming convention for submitting your files:
    -   **Lastname_Firstname_HWx.qmd**, such as Niederhausen_Meike_HW2.qmd
    -   **Lastname_Firstname_HWx.html**, such as Niederhausen_Meike_HW2.html
-   For each question, make sure to **show all of your work**.
    -   This includes all code and resulting output in the html file to support your answers for exercises requiring work done in R (including any arithmetic calculations).
    -   For non-calculation questions, this includes an explanation of your answer (*why did you choose your answer?*).
-   For each question, include a **sentence summarizing the answer** for that question in the context of the research question.

::: callout-tip
It is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along! Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.

Load all the packages you need in the first code chunk of the file that starts with `#| label: "setup"`.

## R1: Palmer Penguins SLR


:::{.callout-important}
Below I frequently use the terminology _variable1 vs. variable2_. When we write this, the first variable is $y$ (vertical axis) and the second is $x$ (horizontal axis). Thus it's always $y$ vs. $x$ (NOT $x$ vs. $y$). 
:::


### (a) Scatterplots

* __For each of the following pairs of variables, make a scatterplot showing the best fit line and describe the relationship between the variables.__
* In particular address 
  * whether the association is linear, 
  * how strong it is (based purely on the plot), and 
  * what direction (positive, negative, or neither).

1. __body mass vs. flipper length__



2. __bill depth vs. flipper length__



3. __bill depth vs. bill length__

### (f) $b_1$ calculation

__Very that the formula__ $b_1 = r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x}$ __holds for this example using the values of the statistics.__


### (g) Interpret intercept 

__Write a sentence interpreting the intercept for this example. Is it meaningful in this example?__ 


### (h) Interpret slope

__Write a sentence interpreting the slope for this example.__ 


### (i) Prediction

__What is the expected body mass of a penguin with flipper length 210 mm based on the model?__ 



## R2: Life expectancy vs. CO2 emissions 

Use the dataset `Gapminder_2011_LifeExp_CO2.csv`

Data were downloaded from https://www.gapminder.org/data/.  

* __Life expectancy__ = the average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same. Source: https://www.gminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/

* __CO2 emissions (tons per person)__ = Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (metric tons of CO2 per person). Source: https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/

* 2011 is the most recent year with the most complete data

### (i) QQ plot comparison

__Compare the QQ plot of the model's residuals to the randomly generated QQ plots. Is the QQ plot of the residuals similar to the randomly generated plots or different? Based on the these QQ plots, do you think it's possible that the residuals could be normally distributed?__

# Nonparametric Tests


## NPT 1: Sign test

__Vegetarian diet and cholesterol levels__

When covering paired t-tests on Day 10 Part 2, the class notes used the example of testing whether a vegetarian diet changed cholesterol levels. The data are in the file `chol213.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F24/data/chol213.csv>. In this exercise we will use non-parametric tests to test for a change and compare the results to the paired t-test.


### (a) Hypotheses

__What are the hypotheses for the sign test (2-sided) in the context of the problem?__ 




### (b) $D^+$ and $D^-$

__Calculate $D^+$ and $D^-$, the number of positive and negative differences when the differences are calculated as `After - Before`.__

## NPT 2: (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

__Vegetarian diet and cholesterol levels__

When covering paired t-tests on Day 10 Part 2, the class notes used the example of testing whether a vegetarian diet changed cholesterol levels. The data are in the file `chol213.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F24/data/chol213.csv>. In this exercise we will use non-parametric tests to test for a change and compare the results to the paired t-test.


### (a) Hypotheses

## NPT 3: Wilcoxon rank-sum test

__Does caffeine increase finger taps/min?__

When covering 2-sample t-tests on Day 11, the class notes used the example of testing whether caffeine increases finger taps/min. The data are in the file `CaffeineTaps.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F24/data/CaffeineTaps.csv>. In this exercise we will use a non-parametric test and compare the results to the paired t-test.


### (a) Condition

__What condition needs to be satisfied to apply the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and is it satisfied for these data?__ 




[__Answer the following questions using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test whether you think the condition has been satisfied or not.__ ]{style="color:green"}
